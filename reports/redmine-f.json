This vulnerability is known as HTTP Response Splitting. While not an attack in itself, response splitting is a vector for several other attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS). This is related to CVE-2020-5247, which fixed this vulnerability but only for regular responses. This has been fixed in 4.3.3 and 3.12.4.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-5249","https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-33vf-4xgg-9r58","https://github.com/puma/puma/commit/c22712fc93284a45a93f9ad7023888f3a65524f3","https://github.com/puma/puma/security/advisories/GHSA-33vf-4xgg-9r58","https://github.com/puma/puma/security/advisories/GHSA-84j7-475p-hp8v","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BMJ3CGZ3DLBJ5WUUKMI5ZFXFJQMXJZIK/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DIHVO3CQMU7BZC7FCTSRJ33YDNS3GFPK/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NJ3LL5F5QADB6LM46GXZETREAKZMQNRD/","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5249","https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/HTTP_Response_Splitting"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2020-8161","PkgName":"rack","InstalledVersion":"2.0.7","FixedVersion":"~> 2.1.3, >= 2.2.0","Title":"rubygem-rack: directory traversal in Rack::Directory","Description":"A directory traversal vulnerability exists in rack < 2.2.0 that allows an attacker perform directory traversal vulnerability in the Rack::Directory app that is bundled with Rack which could result in information disclosure.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8161","https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5f9h-9pjv-v6j7","https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/dddb7ad18ed79ca6ab06ccc417a169fde451246e","https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/rubyonrails-security/IOO1vNZTzPA/Ylzi1UYLAAAJ","https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ruby-security-ann/T4ZIsfRf2eA","https://groups.google.com/g/rubyonrails-security/c/IOO1vNZTzPA","https://hackerone.com/reports/434404","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/07/msg00006.html","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8161","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4561-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-4561-1"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2020-8184","PkgName":"rack","InstalledVersion":"2.0.7","FixedVersion":"~> 2.1.4, >= 2.2.3","Title":"rubygem-rack: percent-encoded cookies can be used to overwrite existing prefixed cookie names","Description":"A reliance on cookies without validation/integrity check security vulnerability exists in rack < 2.2.3, rack < 2.1.4 that makes it is possible for an attacker to forge a secure or host-only cookie prefix.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8184","https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j6w9-fv6q-3q52","https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/rubyonrails-security/OWtmozPH9Ak/4m00yHPCBAAJ","https://groups.google.com/g/rubyonrails-security/c/OWtmozPH9Ak","https://hackerone.com/reports/895727","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/07/msg00006.html","https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8184","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4561-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-4561-1"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-16782","PkgName":"rack","InstalledVersion":"2.0.7","FixedVersion":"~> 1.6.12, >= 2.0.8","Title":"rubygem-rack: hijack sessions by using timing attacks targeting the session id","Description":"There's a possible information leak / session hijack vulnerability in Rack (RubyGem rack).
