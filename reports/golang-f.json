By default, if Bash is run with its effective UID not equal to its real UID, it will drop privileges by setting its effective UID to its real UID. However, it does so incorrectly. On Linux and other systems that support \"saved UID\" functionality, the saved UID is not dropped. An attacker with command execution in the shell can use \"enable -f\" for runtime loading of a new builtin, which can be a shared object that calls setuid() and therefore regains privileges.

Since the kernel's proc_pid_readdir() returns PID entries in ascending numeric order, a process occupying a high PID can use inotify events to determine when the process list is being scanned, and fork/exec to obtain a lower PID, thus avoiding enumeration. An unprivileged attacker can hide a process from procps-ng's utilities by exploiting a race condition in reading /proc/PID entries. This vulnerability affects procps and procps-ng up to version 3.3.15, newer versions might be affected also.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2018/q2/122","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104214","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2018-1121","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1121","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44806/","https://www.qualys.com/2018/05/17/procps-ng-audit-report-advisory.txt"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2018-12928","PkgName":"linux-libc-dev","InstalledVersion":"4.19.171-2","Title":"kernel: NULL pointer dereference in hfs_ext_read_extent in hfs.ko","Description":"In the Linux kernel 4.15.0, a NULL pointer dereference was discovered in hfs_ext_read_extent in hfs.ko.
