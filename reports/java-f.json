When libcurl connects to an FTP server and successfully logs in (anonymous or not), it asks the server for the current directory with the `PWD` command. The server then responds with a 257 response containing the path, inside double quotes. The returned path name is then kept by libcurl for subsequent uses. Due to a flaw in the string parser for this directory name, a directory name passed like this but without a closing double quote would lead to libcurl not adding a trailing NUL byte to the buffer holding the name. When libcurl would then later access the string, it could read beyond the allocated heap buffer and crash or wrongly access data beyond the buffer, thinking it was part of the path. A malicious server could abuse this fact and effectively prevent libcurl-based clients to work with it - the PWD command is always issued on new FTP connections and the mistake has a high chance of causing a segfault. The simple fact that this has issue remained undiscovered for this long could suggest that malformed PWD responses are rare in benign servers. We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. This bug was introduced in commit [415d2e7cb7](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/415d2e7cb7), March 2005. In libcurl version 7.56.0, the parser always zero terminates the string but also rejects it if not terminated properly with a final double quote.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3992","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101115","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039509","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2486","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3558","https://curl.haxx.se/673d0cd8.patch","https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20171004.html","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1000254","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201712-04","https://support.apple.com/HT208331","https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-3441-1","https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-3441-2"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2018-1000121","PkgName":"curl","InstalledVersion":"7.38.0-4+deb8u5","FixedVersion":"7.38.0-4+deb8u10","Title":"curl: LDAP NULL pointer dereference","Description":"A NULL pointer dereference exists in curl 7.21.0 to and including curl 7.58.0 in the LDAP code that allows an attacker to cause a denial of service","Severity":"HIGH","References":["http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2018-4258247.html","http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2018-4428296.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/103415","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1040529","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2019:0327","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3157","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3558","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0544","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0594","https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_2018-97a2.html","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1000121","https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2018-1000121.html","https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2018-3157.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/03/msg00012.html","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3598-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3598-2/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-3598-1","https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-3598-2","https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4136","https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujan2019-5072801.html","https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2019-5072835.html"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2018-16890","PkgName":"curl","InstalledVersion":"7.38.0-4+deb8u5","FixedVersion":"7.38.0-4+deb8u14","Title":"curl: NTLM type-2 heap out-of-bounds buffer read","Description":"libcurl versions from 7.36.0 to before 7.64.0 is vulnerable to a heap buffer out-of-bounds read.

This bug is similar to CVE-2020-5260(GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q). The fix for that bug still left the door open for an exploit where _some_ credential is leaked (but the attacker cannot control which one). Git uses external \"credential helper\" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that are considered illegal as of the recently published Git versions can cause Git to send a \"blank\" pattern to helpers, missing hostname and protocol fields. Many helpers will interpret this as matching _any_ URL, and will return some unspecified stored password, leaking the password to an attacker's server. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to `git clone`. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The root of the problem is in Git itself, which should not be feeding blank input to helpers. However, the ability to exploit the vulnerability in practice depends on which helpers are in use. Credential helpers which are known to trigger the vulnerability: - Git's \"store\" helper - Git's \"cache\" helper - the \"osxkeychain\" helper that ships in Git's \"contrib\" directory Credential helpers which are known to be safe even with vulnerable versions of Git: - Git Credential Manager for Windows Any helper not in this list should be assumed to trigger the vulnerability.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-05/msg00003.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/May/41","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11008","https://github.com/git/git/commit/c44088ecc4b0722636e0a305f9608d3047197282","https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-hjc9-x69f-jqj7","https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q","https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2020-11008.html","https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2020-2337.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/04/msg00015.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/74Q7WVJ6FKLIN62VS2JD2XCNWK5TNKOW/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MOCTR2SEHCPSCOVUQJAGFPGKFMI2VE6V/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PN3FUOXKX3AXTULYV53ACABER2W2FSOU/","https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqq4kterq5s.fsf@gitster.c.googlers.com/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202004-13","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT211183","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4334-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-4334-1"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2020-5260","PkgName":"git","InstalledVersion":"1:2.1.4-2.1+deb8u2","FixedVersion":"1:2.1.4-2.1+deb8u9","Title":"git: Crafted URL containing new lines can cause credential leak","Description":"Affected versions of Git have a vulnerability whereby Git can be tricked into sending private credentials to a host controlled by an attacker. Git uses external \"credential helper\" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that contain an encoded newline can inject unintended values into the credential helper protocol stream, causing the credential helper to retrieve the password for one server (e.g., good.example.com) for an HTTP request being made to another server (e.g., evil.example.com), resulting in credentials for the former being sent to the latter. There are no restrictions on the relationship between the two, meaning that an attacker can craft a URL that will present stored credentials for any host to a host of their choosing. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to git clone. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The problem has been patched in the versions published on April 14th, 2020, going back to v2.17.x. Anyone wishing to backport the change further can do so by applying commit 9a6bbee (the full release includes extra checks for git fsck, but that commit is sufficient to protect clients against the vulnerability). The patched versions are: 2.17.4, 2.18.3, 2.19.4, 2.20.3, 2.21.2, 2.22.3, 2.23.2, 2.24.2, 2.25.3, 2.26.1.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-04/msg00027.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-05/msg00003.html","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/157250/Git-Credential-Helper-Protocol-Newline-Injection.html","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/04/15/5","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/04/15/6","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/04/20/1","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-5260","https://github.com/git/git/commit/9a6bbee8006c24b46a85d29e7b38cfa79e9ab21b","https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q","https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2020-5260.html","https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2020-1513.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/04/msg00010.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/74Q7WVJ6FKLIN62VS2JD2XCNWK5TNKOW/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7TVS5UG6JD3MYIGSBKMIOS6AF7CR5IPI/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MOCTR2SEHCPSCOVUQJAGFPGKFMI2VE6V/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PN3FUOXKX3AXTULYV53ACABER2W2FSOU/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XPCEOIFLLEF24L6GLVJVFZX4CREDEHDF/","https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqqy2qy7xn8.fsf@gitster.c.googlers.com/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202004-13","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT211141","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4329-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-4329-1","https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4657"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-1348","PkgName":"git","InstalledVersion":"1:2.1.4-2.1+deb8u2","FixedVersion":"1:2.1.4-2.1+deb8u8","Title":"git: Arbitrary path overwriting via export-marks in-stream command feature","Description":"An issue was found in Git before v2.24.1, v2.23.1, v2.22.2, v2.21.1, v2.20.2, v2.19.3, v2.18.2, v2.17.3, v2.16.6, v2.15.4, and v2.14.6.

This bug is similar to CVE-2020-5260(GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q). The fix for that bug still left the door open for an exploit where _some_ credential is leaked (but the attacker cannot control which one). Git uses external \"credential helper\" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that are considered illegal as of the recently published Git versions can cause Git to send a \"blank\" pattern to helpers, missing hostname and protocol fields. Many helpers will interpret this as matching _any_ URL, and will return some unspecified stored password, leaking the password to an attacker's server. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to `git clone`. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The root of the problem is in Git itself, which should not be feeding blank input to helpers. However, the ability to exploit the vulnerability in practice depends on which helpers are in use. Credential helpers which are known to trigger the vulnerability: - Git's \"store\" helper - Git's \"cache\" helper - the \"osxkeychain\" helper that ships in Git's \"contrib\" directory Credential helpers which are known to be safe even with vulnerable versions of Git: - Git Credential Manager for Windows Any helper not in this list should be assumed to trigger the vulnerability.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-05/msg00003.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/May/41","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11008","https://github.com/git/git/commit/c44088ecc4b0722636e0a305f9608d3047197282","https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-hjc9-x69f-jqj7","https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q","https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2020-11008.html","https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2020-2337.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/04/msg00015.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/74Q7WVJ6FKLIN62VS2JD2XCNWK5TNKOW/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MOCTR2SEHCPSCOVUQJAGFPGKFMI2VE6V/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PN3FUOXKX3AXTULYV53ACABER2W2FSOU/","https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqq4kterq5s.fsf@gitster.c.googlers.com/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202004-13","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT211183","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4334-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-4334-1"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2020-5260","PkgName":"git-man","InstalledVersion":"1:2.1.4-2.1+deb8u2","FixedVersion":"1:2.1.4-2.1+deb8u9","Title":"git: Crafted URL containing new lines can cause credential leak","Description":"Affected versions of Git have a vulnerability whereby Git can be tricked into sending private credentials to a host controlled by an attacker. Git uses external \"credential helper\" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that contain an encoded newline can inject unintended values into the credential helper protocol stream, causing the credential helper to retrieve the password for one server (e.g., good.example.com) for an HTTP request being made to another server (e.g., evil.example.com), resulting in credentials for the former being sent to the latter. There are no restrictions on the relationship between the two, meaning that an attacker can craft a URL that will present stored credentials for any host to a host of their choosing. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to git clone. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The problem has been patched in the versions published on April 14th, 2020, going back to v2.17.x.

When libcurl connects to an FTP server and successfully logs in (anonymous or not), it asks the server for the current directory with the `PWD` command. The server then responds with a 257 response containing the path, inside double quotes. The returned path name is then kept by libcurl for subsequent uses. Due to a flaw in the string parser for this directory name, a directory name passed like this but without a closing double quote would lead to libcurl not adding a trailing NUL byte to the buffer holding the name. When libcurl would then later access the string, it could read beyond the allocated heap buffer and crash or wrongly access data beyond the buffer, thinking it was part of the path. A malicious server could abuse this fact and effectively prevent libcurl-based clients to work with it - the PWD command is always issued on new FTP connections and the mistake has a high chance of causing a segfault. The simple fact that this has issue remained undiscovered for this long could suggest that malformed PWD responses are rare in benign servers. We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. This bug was introduced in commit [415d2e7cb7](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/415d2e7cb7), March 2005. In libcurl version 7.56.0, the parser always zero terminates the string but also rejects it if not terminated properly with a final double quote.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3992","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101115","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039509","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2486","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3558","https://curl.haxx.se/673d0cd8.patch","https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20171004.html","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1000254","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201712-04","https://support.apple.com/HT208331","https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-3441-1","https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-3441-2"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2018-1000121","PkgName":"libcurl3","InstalledVersion":"7.38.0-4+deb8u5","FixedVersion":"7.38.0-4+deb8u10","Title":"curl: LDAP NULL pointer dereference","Description":"A NULL pointer dereference exists in curl 7.21.0 to and including curl 7.58.0 in the LDAP code that allows an attacker to cause a denial of service","Severity":"HIGH","References":["http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2018-4258247.html","http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2018-4428296.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/103415","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1040529","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2019:0327","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3157","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3558","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0544","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0594","https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_2018-97a2.html","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1000121","https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2018-1000121.html","https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2018-3157.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/03/msg00012.html","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3598-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3598-2/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-3598-1","https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-3598-2","https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4136","https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujan2019-5072801.html","https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2019-5072835.html"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2018-16890","PkgName":"libcurl3","InstalledVersion":"7.38.0-4+deb8u5","FixedVersion":"7.38.0-4+deb8u14","Title":"curl: NTLM type-2 heap out-of-bounds buffer read","Description":"libcurl versions from 7.36.0 to before 7.64.0 is vulnerable to a heap buffer out-of-bounds read.

When libcurl connects to an FTP server and successfully logs in (anonymous or not), it asks the server for the current directory with the `PWD` command. The server then responds with a 257 response containing the path, inside double quotes. The returned path name is then kept by libcurl for subsequent uses. Due to a flaw in the string parser for this directory name, a directory name passed like this but without a closing double quote would lead to libcurl not adding a trailing NUL byte to the buffer holding the name. When libcurl would then later access the string, it could read beyond the allocated heap buffer and crash or wrongly access data beyond the buffer, thinking it was part of the path. A malicious server could abuse this fact and effectively prevent libcurl-based clients to work with it - the PWD command is always issued on new FTP connections and the mistake has a high chance of causing a segfault. The simple fact that this has issue remained undiscovered for this long could suggest that malformed PWD responses are rare in benign servers. We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. This bug was introduced in commit [415d2e7cb7](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/415d2e7cb7), March 2005.

No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH1024 are considered just feasible, because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This only affects processors that support the AVX2 but not ADX extensions like Intel Haswell (4th generation).

However, in some cases, it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an application using libcrypto.

If the application then behaves differently based on that in a way that is detectable to the remote peer, then this amounts to a padding oracle that could be used to decrypt data.

If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as well (for example, to overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys file).","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-06/msg00058.html","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/04/18/1","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106741","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3702","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1677794","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-6111","https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/src/usr.bin/ssh/scp.c","https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2019-6111.html","https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2019-3702.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/c45d9bc90700354b58fb7455962873c44229841880dcb64842fa7d23@%3Cdev.mina.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/c7301cab36a86825359e1b725fc40304d1df56dc6d107c1fe885148b@%3Cdev.mina.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/d540139359de999b0f1c87d05b715be4d7d4bec771e1ae55153c5c7a@%3Cdev.mina.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/e47597433b351d6e01a5d68d610b4ba195743def9730e49561e8cf3f@%3Cdev.mina.apache.org%3E","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/03/msg00030.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/W3YVQ2BPTOVDCFDVNC2GGF5P5ISFG37G/","https://lists.mindrot.org/pipermail/openssh-unix-dev/2019-January/037459.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201903-16","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190213-0001/","https://sintonen.fi/advisories/scp-client-multiple-vulnerabilities.txt","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3885-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3885-2/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-3885-1","https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-3885-2","https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4387","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46193/","https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-EN-19:10.scp.asc","https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2019-5072832.html"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2015-6563","PkgName":"openssh-client","InstalledVersion":"1:6.7p1-5+deb8u3","FixedVersion":"1:6.7p1-5+deb8u6","Title":"openssh: Privilege separation weakness related to PAM support","Description":"The monitor component in sshd in OpenSSH before 7.0 on non-OpenBSD platforms accepts extraneous username data in MONITOR_REQ_PAM_INIT_CTX requests, which allows local users to conduct impersonation attacks by leveraging any SSH login access in conjunction with control of the sshd uid to send a crafted MONITOR_REQ_PWNAM request, related to monitor.c and monitor_wrap.c.","Severity":"LOW","References":["http://lists.apple.com/archives/security-announce/2015/Oct/msg00005.html","http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/package-announce/2015-August/165170.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2015-09/msg00017.html","http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-0741.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2015/Aug/54","http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-7.0","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/08/11/9","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/08/22/1","http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/bulletinjan2016-2867206.html","http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/linuxbulletinapr2016-2952096.html","http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/linuxbulletinoct2015-2719645.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/76317","https://anongit.mindrot.org/openssh.git/commit/?id=d4697fe9a28dab7255c60433e4dd23cf7fce8a8b","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-6563","https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/commit/d4697fe9a28dab7255c60433e4dd23cf7fce8a8b","https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2015-6563.html","https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2016-0741.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/09/msg00010.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201512-04","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20180201-0002/","https://support.apple.com/HT205375","https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2710-1/","https://www.broadcom.com/support/fibre-channel-networking/security-advisories/brocade-security-advisory-2019-766"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2016-8610","PkgName":"openssl","InstalledVersion":"1.0.1t-1+deb8u5","FixedVersion":"1.0.1t-1+deb8u6","Title":"SSL/TLS: Malformed plain-text ALERT packets could cause remote DoS","Description":"A denial of service flaw was found in OpenSSL 0.9.8, 1.0.1, 1.0.2 through 1.0.2h, and 1.1.0 in the way the TLS/SSL protocol defined processing of ALERT packets during a connection handshake.

No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH1024 are considered just feasible, because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This only affects processors that support the AVX2 but not ADX extensions like Intel Haswell (4th generation). Note: The impact from this issue is similar to CVE-2017-3736, CVE-2017-3732 and CVE-2015-3193. OpenSSL version 1.0.2-1.0.2m and 1.1.0-1.1.0g are affected. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2n. Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing a new release of OpenSSL 1.1.0 at this time. The fix will be included in OpenSSL 1.1.0h when it becomes available. The fix is also available in commit e502cc86d in the OpenSSL git repository.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuapr2018-3678067.html","http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujan2018-3236628.html","http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2018-4258247.html","http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2018-4428296.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/102118","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039978","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0998","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2185","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2186","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2187","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3738","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/e502cc86df9dafded1694fceb3228ee34d11c11a","https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2017-3738.html","https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2018-0998.html","https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/december-2017-security-releases/","https://security.FreeBSD.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-17:12.openssl.asc","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201712-03","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20171208-0001/","https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docLocale=en_US&docId=emr_na-hpesbst03881en_us","https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-3512-1","https://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-4065","https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4157","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20171207.txt","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20180327.txt","https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuapr2019-5072813.html","https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujan2019-5072801.html","https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2019-5072835.html","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2017-16","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2018-04","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2018-06","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2018-07"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2018-0735","PkgName":"openssl","InstalledVersion":"1.0.1t-1+deb8u5","FixedVersion":"1.0.1t-1+deb8u10","Title":"openssl: timing side channel attack in the ECDSA signature generation","Description":"The OpenSSL ECDSA signature algorithm has been shown to be vulnerable to a timing side channel attack.

However, in some cases, it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an application using libcrypto.

If the application then behaves differently based on that in a way that is detectable to the remote peer, then this amounts to a padding oracle that could be used to decrypt data.
