CRLF injection is possible if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \\r\\n (specifically in the host component of a URL) followed by an HTTP header. This is similar to the CVE-2019-9740 query string issue and the CVE-2019-9947 path string issue. (This is not exploitable when glibc has CVE-2016-10739 fixed.). This is fixed in: v2.7.18, v2.7.18rc1; v3.5.10, v3.5.10rc1; v3.6.11, v3.6.11rc1, v3.6.12; v3.7.8, v3.7.8rc1, v3.7.9; v3.8.3, v3.8.3rc1, v3.8.4, v3.8.4rc1, v3.8.5, v3.8.6, v3.8.6rc1.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-05/msg00041.html","https://bugs.python.org/issue30458#msg347282","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1727276","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18348","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/07/msg00011.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4X3HW5JRZ7GCPSR7UHJOLD7AWLTQCDVR/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/A5NSAX4SC3V64PGZUPH7PRDLSON34Q5A/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JCPGLTTOBB3QEARDX4JOYURP6ELNNA2V/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/M34WOYCDKTDE5KLUACE2YIEH7D37KHRX/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UESGYI5XDAHJBATEZN3MHNDUBDH47AS6/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20191107-0004/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4333-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4333-2/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-4333-1","https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-4333-2","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2020-8492","PkgName":"python2.7-minimal","InstalledVersion":"2.7.16-2+deb10u1","Title":"python: wrong backtracking in urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler allows for a ReDoS","Description":"Python 2.7 through 2.7.17, 3.5 through 3.5.9, 3.6 through 3.6.10, 3.7 through 3.7.6, and 3.8 through 3.8.1 allows an HTTP server to conduct Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks against a client because of urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler catastrophic backtracking.","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-03/msg00003.html","https://bugs.python.org/issue39503","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8492","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/0b297d4ff1c0e4480ad33acae793fbaf4bf015b4","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/18284","https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2020-8492.html","https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2020-4433.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/07/msg00011.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7WOKDEXLYW5UQ4S7PA7E37IITOC7C56J/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/A5NSAX4SC3V64PGZUPH7PRDLSON34Q5A/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/APGWEMYZIY5VHLCSZ3HD67PA5Z2UQFGH/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UESGYI5XDAHJBATEZN3MHNDUBDH47AS6/","https://python-security.readthedocs.io/vuln/urllib-basic-auth-regex.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202005-09","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200221-0001/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4333-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4333-2/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-4333-1","https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-4333-2","https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-4754-3"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"TEMP-0517018-A83CE6","PkgName":"sysvinit-utils","InstalledVersion":"2.93-8","Severity":"LOW"},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2005-2541","PkgName":"tar","InstalledVersion":"1.30+dfsg-6","Description":"Tar 1.15.1 does not properly warn the user when extracting setuid or setgid files, which may allow local users or remote attackers to gain privileges.","Severity":"CRITICAL","References":["http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=112327628230258&w=2"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-9923","PkgName":"tar","InstalledVersion":"1.30+dfsg-6","Title":"tar: null-pointer dereference in pax_decode_header in sparse.c","Description":"pax_decode_header in sparse.c in GNU Tar before 1.32 had a NULL pointer dereference when parsing certain archives that have malformed extended headers.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/tar.git/commit/?id=cb07844454d8cc9fb21f53ace75975f91185a120","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-04/msg00077.html","http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?55369","https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tar/+bug/1810241","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9923","https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-4692-1"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2021-20193","PkgName":"tar","InstalledVersion":"1.30+dfsg-6","Title":"tar: Memory leak in read_header() in list.c","Description":"A flaw was found in the src/list.c of tar.
